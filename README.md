#My Portfolio
#Project Description:
* CSS Grid was used for the layout the webpage. In order to control the child grid elements I had to change the minmax to 25% to control the grid auto rows function. 
* I took care to nest all of my child elements with their own children divs/span elements.
* Text image overlays are nested inside Span elements in order to control it's orienatation inside parent div however it was still difficult to align properly without affecting surrounding non-nested grid children. 
* @media queries are listed however does not initialize well due to CSS grid Children auto formatting with during screen changes.
* Used Psuedo Selector for nav hover animation.
